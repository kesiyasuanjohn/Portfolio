                <h3>Smart Waste Reporting and Collection System</h3>
                <p>A smart waste management system where users report waste via a
                    website, pinpointing locations and uploading images. The data gets
                    stored into Firebase from which it can be accessed by the registered
                    organizations. Registered organizations receive notifications, accept
                    reports, and send their teams for clean up. Users get updates and can
                    rate organizations. The system includes a report history feature and a
                    marketplace for recycled products sold by organizations, accessible
                    through the user dashboard.
                    <strong>Technologies</strong>: HTML,CSS, Javascript, Firebase, Google Map API</p>
